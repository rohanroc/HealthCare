				<span class="cw-label">What are the treatment options for depression?</span>
				<div class="cw-acordion-cont">
					<p>It depends on what kind of question you have. Here are a few suggestions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li> <b class="col">Psychotherapy :</b>  Talk therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT), can help individuals identify and address negative thought patterns and develop healthy coping strategies.</li>
						<li> <b>Medication : </b> Antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), may be prescribed to help regulate brain chemicals associated with mood.</li>
						<li> <b>Combination therapy :</b> In some cases, a combination of psychotherapy and medication may be recommended for more severe or persistent depression.</li>
						<li> <b>Lifestyle changes :</b> Engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and reducing stress can all have a positive impact on mood.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In general, it's a good idea to start by doing some research on your own to see if you can find the answer to your question online or through other resources. If you're still unsure, reaching out to an expert or professional in the relevant field is often a good next step.</p>

					<p>If you want to cancel or change an order, you should contact the company or organization from which you made the purchase as soon as possible.
